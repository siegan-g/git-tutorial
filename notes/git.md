# Git

- Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) as an alternative Version Control System to manage Linux's codebase. 


## Main Functions

1. Audit Trail: Track and manage all alterations and changes made to every file in a directory (now a called a repository)

2. Version Control: Versioning of your codebase can be done with branches which are isolated workspaces

3. Collaboration: When connected to a remote repository Git allows multiple individuals to copy the entire repository and contribute to the project


### Alternatives

- SVN - A centralised version control system
- Mecury - Another distributed version control system
